The following section will explain how to join additional worker nodes to your
k3s deployment.

# Worker node(s)

First of all, you will need to get the cluster token, as explained in the previous section and the master node _fqdn_.

## Deploy k3s to join an existing cluster

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | \
    K3S_URL="https://k3s-mstr.vlab.lcl:6443" \
    K3S_TOKEN="K10d1...fe537::server:26a92...e34f9" \
    sh -
```

## Check

From the master node or any client device with access to the Kubernetes cluster, ensure that the node is now added to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
